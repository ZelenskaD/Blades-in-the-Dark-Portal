| Data       | What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack, you are required to create your own API. | The [Blades in the Dark API Spec](https://blades-portal-api.surganov.dev)  has all functionality that I need to create the website. User data for my database will be collected on registration (email/password) with using hashing and through use of features in the site (making campaigns, creating/editing user profile and characters profiles, admin access with the abilities: remove/add new players to the campaign, makeing new info posts). |
